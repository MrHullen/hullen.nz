# Hullen.nz

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, [Hullen.nz](https://hullen.nz).

## Folders

`/src/` contains all the code I've written for the web pages.

`/src/lib/` contains the reusable components that make up each page.

`/src/routes/` contains each individual page as its own file.

## Technologies

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is the main framework in which the website is written. It makes writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript much easier by handling a lot of the interactions between the languages. It also improves the website code to make it faster and nicer for users.

[Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is the CSS framework that provides the style and layout for the website. It makes the website accessible on more devices and browsers.


[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is Googles hosting and database platform. It keeps the public version of the website in the cloud for users to access.
